<h3>THE IHT SPIRIT SYSTEM HEART RATE MONITOR IS IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN</h3>
<strong><u>Simplicity</u></strong>: It can’t get any easier than this. The Spirit Monitor turns itself on and begins to work as soon as it’s put on and shuts off when taken off. Data is instantly sent to students and parents.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No Moving Parts, Never Lost</span></strong>: The Spirit Monitor is one piece and the software eliminates all risk of losing a monitor as it tracks each HRM every time a student swipes it. The teacher’s always knows who has the monitor, who’s picked up and who has returned or not returned.

<strong><u>Durability</u></strong>: IHT offers a one year warranty and an additional service plan to cover all expenses, refurbishment and battery changes. We also designed the monitor for extreme durability and working with active kids, class after class, day after day.

<strong><u>No Limits on Distance or Range</u></strong>: Use it in the gym, on a 5-mile run or take the Spirit Monitor home for the weekend. There’s no limit to the possibilities of its use.

<strong><u>Real-Time Feedback</u></strong>: Real-time feedback is based on auditory feedback as students move from one zone to another and also real time visual feedback at any time participants go to the computer to see their progress thus far. This approach accelerates the learning curve for an innate, more in-depth understanding of a student’s own body. The result is the reinforcement of self-directed and self-sufficient learning, with immediate feedback sent to their phone or computer to verify and document their personal application of moderate to vigorous performance.

<strong><u>Personal Data and Connection</u></strong>: We keep this personal and private and about each individual.

<strong><u>No Cross Talk</u></strong>: Eliminates all cross talk, so each student's data is true and accurate and all their own, from start to finish.
