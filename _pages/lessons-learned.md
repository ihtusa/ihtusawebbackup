“It showed me what I needed to do to get that intensity. Being a track athlete and being as fit as I am, it showed me how much I actually have to work to get into that zone. I can’t just take it light and train light if I want to improve.” – Justin Lehmkuhler, 8<sup>th</sup> grade PE student at <a href="http://www.woodford.kyschools.us/2/Home" target="_blank">Woodford County (Ky.) Middle School</a> who conducted an independent study project in PE using the IHT Spirit System. He later presented his findings at the University of Kentucky.

“It’s getting better and better. I think I just figured out how I can use the data to reinforce the idea that you need to be active.” - John Kruse, PE teacher at <a href="http://www.nobelms.com/index.jsp" target="_blank">Nobel Charter (Calif.) Middle School</a>, Los Angeles Unified School District

“The other thing I noticed with the kids is that they’ll run over to the computer to check where their heart-rate is, to see if they’ve met their goal yet. If it’s toward the end of the hour, they will step aside and do a bunch of jumping jacks, push-ups or something to get their heart rate going again if they haven’t met their goal. I think that’s pretty cool.” – Ben Hemberger, PE teacher and basketball coach at <a href="http://www.fosston.k12.mn.us/" target="_blank">Fosston (Minn.) High School</a>
