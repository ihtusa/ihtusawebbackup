<h3>DIRECTOR NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT &amp; PARTNERSHIPS, adidas</h3>
Kim Scheffler has been integrating electronics and textiles for 9 years. She was part the commercial launch of the NuMetrex Heart Rate Monitoring apparel line at Textronics and carried her textile-focused product development &amp; commercialization role into the adidas miCoach line when Textronics was purchased in 2008.

Kim’s knowledge of fibers was learned in various roles in her 16 years at DuPont – from NOMEX®’s fire retardant properties to body-hugging LYCRA® spandex in swimwear and intimate apparel, Kim learned about fiber, fabric and garment properties thru various technical, management and business roles.

While in high school in Kentucky, Kim developed a love of basketball and was recruited to play at Yale University where she earned a B.S. in chemical engineering.   Although basketball is no longer a daily part of life, Kim enjoys staying active with her husband, Mike, and their two teenage sons who are involved in sports every season as well as scrapbooking and jewelry making with friends whenever she can squeeze it in.
