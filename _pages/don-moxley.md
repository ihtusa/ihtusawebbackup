    Don’s athletic background gives him first-hand experience in what quality physical education looks like. An accomplished athlete, Don served as captain of the Ohio State University wrestling team. In 1985 he helped the Buckeyes earn a Big 10 Championship. He remained close to athletics and education after graduation. Earlier this year he began working with the Ohio State wrestling team as Sport Science Consultant.
    Don loves to learn, loves to teach and loves to coach. His background includes a role as an Assistant Professor in the Sports Studies Department at Urbana University, where he coordinated the Exercise Science program. He’s also worked as a consultant for sports/fitness facilities, individual athletes and sport organizations and owns Lemonade Neighborhood Fitness. He founded ViA Performance Systems.
    The cornerstone of Don’s practice is his ability to integrate technology, purchased or invented, that gives exercisers the ability to track their performance in strength and cardiovascular training programs on a workout-by-workout basis.
    Away from work, Don’s personal time goes to supporting his wife and his daughter's lacrosse dreams. His daughter is entering her senior year in high school and was invited to become a member of the OSU Lacrosse team after graduation.
