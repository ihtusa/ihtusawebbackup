<h3 style="font-size: 44px; text-align: center;">THE ADIDAS ZONE FOR IHT SPIRIT</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">We designed the adidas ZONE for IHT Spirit with the specific goal of creating the gold standard in group fitness training. Our wrist-only digital heart rate monitors and suite of game changing data collection and reporting software allow you to see and measure results in helping individuals take a self-directed, self-motivated ownership approach to their health.</p>

<h3>BUILT TO LAST. DEPENDABLE.</h3>
<strong><u>Durability</u></strong>: IHT offers a one year warranty and an additional service plan to cover all expenses and refurbishment.  We also designed the adidas ZONE for extreme durability and working with active kids, class after class, day after day, year after year.

<strong><u>No Limits on Distance or Range</u></strong>: Use it in the gym, on a 5-mile run or take the Adidas ZONE home for the weekend. There’s no limit to the possibilities of its use.

<strong><u>Real-Time Feedback</u></strong>: You’ll see visual feedback both in ZONE colors of blue, (low intensity), yellow (moderate intensity) and red (vigorous intensity) when individual’s move from one zone into the next.  Visual display can also be seen in beats per minute.  Facilitators can choose to have one or all displays and feedback loops on or off.

<h3>SIMPLE. COMFORTABLE. EASY TO USE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>It’s All in the Wrist!</u></strong> No more chest straps ever needed! The adidas Zone’s comfortable and adjustable wrist band will fit the smallest wrists of your kindergartners to your most athletic senior football players, allowing you to track and support every student daily to yearly from K-12.</p>
<strong><u>Simplicity</u></strong>: It can’t get any easier than this. The adidas ZONE turns itself on and begins to work as soon as it’s put on and shuts off when taken off. Data is instantly sent to students and parents as soon as class is over.

<strong><u>No Moving Parts, Never Lost</u></strong>: The Adidas ZONE is one piece and the software eliminates all risk of losing a monitor as it tracks each HRM every time a student swipes it. Teachers always know who has the monitor, who’s picked up and who has returned or not returned.

<h3>ACCURATE DATA FOR EACH STUDENT</h3>
<strong><u>Personal Data and Connection</u></strong>: We keep this personal and private and about each individual.

<strong><u>No Cross Talk</u></strong>: Eliminates all cross talk, so each student's data is true and accurate and all their own, from start to finish.

<strong><u>Battery Life</u></strong>: The power consumption of the adidas ZONE will last up to 5 days.  The charging unit is also the storage case and is designed to allow each battery to charge quickly to always be at full charge for the demands of class after class use.

<strong><u>Affordable</u></strong>: Designed for group training, one class set facilitates all class periods and all students throughout the day. So, if your largest class is 30 students, you only need 30 adidas ZONE’s to reach hundreds of students throughout the day in each period.
