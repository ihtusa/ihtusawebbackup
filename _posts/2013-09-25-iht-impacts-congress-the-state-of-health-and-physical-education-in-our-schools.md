<div class="section">September 2010 marked the first Childhood Obesity Awareness Month - a month designated by Congress to draw attention to what has become a national epidemic. This effort was led by U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge and U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Now, three years later we will look at what schools and school districts are doing to combat the childhood obesity issue, and the role Congress can play in reversing this unhealthy trend.</div>
