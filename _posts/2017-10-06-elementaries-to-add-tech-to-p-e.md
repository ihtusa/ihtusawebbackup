<p class="article-meta">Sometime soon, students coming to Mario Nava’s physical education classes at Sunset and Northridge elementary will start their PE classes by strapping on what looks like a watch.</p>
<p class="inner"></p>
“Almost every class will attach a heart rate monitor that looks like a watch,” Nava said. “It will track their heart rate at all times. As they are moving through PE they can check their heart rate and immediately know where they are at — if they need to get moving a little bit or slow down a little bit.”<!--more-->

The plan is to purchase the monitors in November, thanks not only to fund-raising efforts at each school but also a $2,300 grant from the Kansas Health Foundation-Newton Fund administrated by the Central Kansas Community Foundation.

<p class="inner">The fundraisers at the schools and grants raised more than $7,000 for the project.</p>
<p class="inner">“The heart is huge ... I wanted to stress the importance of taking care of yourself and living a healthy, active lifestyle,” Nava said.</p>
<p class="inner">The heart rate monitor on each student’s wrist can be scanned by a base station connected to a computer. That can send information to teachers and parents. Students’ daily efforts can be recorded, stored over time and used to analyze the effectiveness of activities in the classroom.</p>
<p class="inner">“It can be instantly sent to students, teachers and parents if they sign up for that option,” Nava said. “They can see how active they were. ... It is a learning tool for students to see how important it is to stay healthy and maintain an active lifestyle — not just while you are young but as you get older.”</p>
<p class="inner">The school district will own 28 wrist heart rate monitors, a charging station, a classroom reader for data and a three-year software license.“It is state of the art,” Nava said. “We will be the third or fourth school in the state to have this. This is new technology that I think that every school, if they have the funds available, should have.”</p>
