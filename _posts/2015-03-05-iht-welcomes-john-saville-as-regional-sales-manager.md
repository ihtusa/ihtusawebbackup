AUSTIN, TX, March 5, 2015 -- Interactive Health Technologies (IHT), an Austin-based company whose “Spirit System” is transforming physical education through the use of technology, proudly welcomes John Saville from to the team.

John brings his seasoned and accomplished sales and managerial experience to IHT with the overall responsibility for directing our West and Northeast sales efforts, as well as overseeing our international growth, best practices and customer service levels.

John’s impact in the physical education industry over the past 22 years is far-reaching and unparalleled. John first established himself as a leader in the profession as Director of Sales for HealthFirst in January 1994. Over 8 years he led the sales team in the development of key markets from start up to the acquisition by Polar Electro, a multinational company. With that merger, John joined Polar’s sales team as Regional Sales Manager. Due to his incredible success, he quickly moved into more developed roles, which included National Sales Manager, US Director of Business to Business Sales, and International Sales Director. Along with managing growth, emerging market opportunities and forging strong relationships with school districts, teachers and educational leaders, nationally and abroad, he exceeded sales goals in the education market and led the business-to-business division to its largest growth in company history. In addition, John contributed to the development of key technology concepts that helped drive the market, winning the 2002 “Above and Beyond Award” for surpassing sales quotas and contributing to the development of the market segment.

For several years, John has served as a consultant for multiple US and Canadian Fitness manufacturers and services providers, enhancing their efforts in business development, market analysis, marketing concept development and sales process development.

“I am excited to be working with a company that is so passionate about education and healthcare. IHT is a leader in assessment technology in the physical education industry and I can’t wait to bring my sales experience to help enhance their worthwhile efforts,” said John Saville.

John is originally from Ontario, Canada and attended The University of Waterloo, graduating with BSC in Kinesiology. He currently lives in the San Francisco Bay area with his wife Kathy Dee.

<strong>About IHT</strong>

IHT’s Spirit System is an integrated web-based heart rate and assessment system that connects students with daily fitness and academic outcomes from K-12th grade. Through heart rate monitors worn in PE classes students are empowered to self-manage their well-being. The Spirit System curriculum and email feedback provides teachers and parents the tools to support students. By moving away from the “one size fits all” approach to physical education and assessment, IHT individualizes the process, creating greater autonomy and personal responsibility while validating the importance of daily physical activity within the school day.
