<div id="blox-ad-position-fixed-big-ad-top-asset1" class="tnt-ads tnt-image-ad-wrapper"><!--more-->The move is important as the district moves toward transitioning to K-6 buildings over the next few years when two new elementary schools are constructed to replace Jefferson-Lincoln and Fords Prairie, according to district officials.</div>
<h4>Addition of Year-Round Physical Education</h4>
</div>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The change will allow students at the district’s primary schools access to year-round physical education, bringing the district closer to compliance with the state’s requirements of 100 minutes of PE and health education per week.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Kristy Vetter, executive director of teaching and learning for the district, said the changes will bring physical education classes to students twice a week, while under the old schedule PE classes were not year round.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Doing this switch allows us to do physical education every single week of the year,” Vetter said, adding that studies have shown PE has a positive impact on student’s learning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The extended school day will also allow for more instructional time in core classes, such as reading and math.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Recommended instructional minutes increase intervention times for both subjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s a change that teachers have met with enthusiasm, Vetter said, especially since the new schedule guarantees teachers will get 30 minutes of preparation time during the school day.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Ed Petersen, communications and public relations coordinator for the district, said teachers’ contracted hours will not change, so there won’t be a budget impact.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“This adds extra learning time without breaking the bank,” he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">According to a memo sent out to staff, principals will work with their respective buildings to adjust schedules and make necessary shifts.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the end of the year, the additional instructional time will add up to have a big impact on students, Vetter said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Every minute counts, always,” she said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The new schedule will affect pickup and dropoff times for students who ride buses. In mid-August, the district will have current information on how the bus routes change. That can be accessed online at <a href="http://www.centralia.k12.wa.us/">www.centralia.k12.wa.us</a> by clicking on “Students and Parents,” and then “Bus Route Information.” Parents can enter an address and school grade to receive estimated pick up and drop off times.</span></p>
