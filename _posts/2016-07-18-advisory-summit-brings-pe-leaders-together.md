IHT, along with partner adidas, held its first Advisory and Innovation Summit in Austin. Physical education teachers, school administrators, foundation managers and state PE coordinators joined us for a day of conversation, demonstration and – most importantly – sharing as we work to create a better PE experience for students.

<h2>Introducing the adidas ZONE</h2>
At the summit we demonstrated the new <a href="http://ihtusa.com/zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adidas ZONE for IHT Spirit</a> heart rate monitor. Alongside the ZONE, we showcased the <a href="http://ihtusa.com/spirit-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IHT Spirit System</a> software's diverse capabilities. As funding is always a challenge for schools, a variety of educators and funders presented different places to find the funding for PE curriculum, technology, and professional development.

With a busy and informative agenda, the day's true value came from the conversations that evolved around each topic. As the day came to a close, each of us left inspired by the quality of individuals at the summit and the perspectives that they openly shared. _
<h2>Ready to learn</h2>
Throughout the day at <a href="http://www.ideapublicschools.org/our-schools/idea-allan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IDEA Allan</a>, one of the Austin campuses of our partner <a href="http://www.ideapublicschools.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IDEA Public Schools</a>, a key conversation centered on getting students “ready to learn.” Teachers and administrators embrace the belief that PE plays a key role in delivering students to English, math or social studies more ready to learn.

Scott Taylor, the principal at <a href="https://schools.district279.org/pb/about-us/mr-taylors-page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Park Brook Elementary</a> in Osseo, Minn., explained how incorporating physical education and physical activity produced dramatic improvement in math and reading proficiency. He also cited a stunning drop in behavioral incidents. The changes came after he encouraged teachers across the school to include physical activity throughout the day, not only during PE. “We added activity everywhere and saw behavioral issues disappear and academic proficiencies increase,” he said. “You gain learning time by giving up instructional time.”
<h2>Summit reminds us of our purpose</h2>

The IHT Spirit System is a comprehensive physical education assessment platform with new optical wrist HRM technology to assess PE students in action. Then we put that information into the hands of teachers so they can affect positive change in their students’ lives. The ZONE is the next exciting tool we have created to deliver that information.

Through the Spirit System, IHT collects data better than anyone. Data collection is just the first step on our mission to empower students to self-manage their health and well-being through technology and coaching. Data creates insight. Insight drives reports. Reports change behaviors.

By changing the behaviors around physical fitness and well-being, we can create healthy kids who turn into healthy adults.
