<strong>Students fired up to get fit</strong>

<a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_7485-e1483714651923-150x150.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-2854 size-full" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG_7485-e1483714651923-150x150.jpg" alt="Parker" width="150" height="150"></a>EDINBORO - Technology is helping James W. Parker Middle School students get physically fit.

A "Spirit System" by Interactive Health Technologies, including heart monitor "watches," helps students track cardiovascular results during workouts.

<!--more-->"The investment is in our students," said Parker physical education teacher Robert Santos. "Our district and our (health and physical education) department believe that students should be exposed to a variety of opportunities throughout their education experience. It is part of what we call the new PE."

Also inspiring students to get fit is a new exercise technology room created by the physical education and art departments. The room houses the monitors, docking stations, PCs and software for the new fitness program and is decorated with murals by seventh-grade art students depicting movement.

<div>"Our hope ... was to entice students to get active and create a sense of excitement about physical education," art teacher Christina Martin said.The exercise technology room also houses fitness technology purchased by teachers in 2015 with grant money: an Xbox 360 Kinect with fitness, dance and sports-related games for students.</div>
