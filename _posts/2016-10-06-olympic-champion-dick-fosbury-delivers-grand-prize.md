<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, Sept. 30, track legend </span><a href="http://www.dickfosbury.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dick Fosbury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped IHT celebrate an innovative group of physical education students at </span><a href="http://wshe.es/pjUC2KId"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay View Middle School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by delivering the grand prize from the IHT Spirit Video Challenge powered by adidas. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fosbury delivered a classroom set of new </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas ZONE for IHT Spirit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrist heart rate monitors to </span><a href="http://bayviewhssd.weebly.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay View</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teacher Kaitlyn Bloemer.  He then participated in PE classes after speaking to the entire school during a </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/185596569"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pep rally Friday morning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Watch a video recap of the pep rally and visit <a href="https://vimeo.com/185596569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s always very special to have an Olympic Gold Medalist, and one who’s so well-known that he’s left his legacy in his sport, [speak to our students],” said Bay View Principal Steve Meyers.</span>
<h4><b>‘I have to do something different’</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“When they raised the bar to 5 feet, 6 inches, I had never made that height before,” said Fosbury as he shared the story of how he developed the jumping style that now bears his name. “I thought, ‘I have to do something different.’”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach new heights, Fosbury used his engineering skills to innovate a new method for his jumps. The jump is officially named the “</span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/10.20.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fosbury Flop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” after Fosbury cleared the bar by jumping back-first and flopping over the bar. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fosbury used the skills that later led him to a career in engineering to develop a different style, one in which he jumped back-first and flopped over the bar. It worked, and the Fosbury Flop was born.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Fosbury’s flop, the Zone monitors represent our latest innovation to improve physical education. The wrist-based heart rate monitor allows students to see how hard they are exercising. The monitors change color based on the student’s heart rate zone, helping them understand what vigorous exercise feels like. </span>
<h4><b>PE Technology</b></h4>
[caption id="attachment_2686" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_0717.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2686" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_0717-300x169.jpg" alt="Fosbury" width="300" height="169" /></a> Bay View PE students with Dick Fosbury[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The monitors bring heart rate monitor technology to PE. IHT’s Spirit System collects data from the Zone monitors to generate a visualization of each student’s individual workout session. The Spirit System allows teachers to assess </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/spirit-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PE performance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, track success and measure achievement aligned with nationally defined standards. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we’ve integrated technology into math and social studies and other subject areas, [more people are understanding] the prominent place that it can play in our physical education programs,” said Meyers.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fosbury emphasized the importance of using technology to accumulate data in physical education.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s really important today that I’ve learned is that it is critically important to have data to be able to monitor where your progress is,” he said. </span>
<h4><b>Making memories</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the Zone’s release, IHT and adidas conducted a Spirit Video Challenge last spring. Students and teachers submitted videos demonstrating how they raised the bar in their physical education classes. The grand prize included a classroom set of the new monitors in addition to three years of the IHT Spirit System software. The 60 videos entered in the contest generated 29,000 votes. And can we mention that the videos gained 63,000 plays as well? <a href="https://www.wishpond.com/lp/1582130/entries/93369800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bay View's winning video</a> had more than 4,000 views.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today was an awesome experience for our students to hear an incredible story,” said Damian LaCroix, the superintendent of schools at the Howard-Suamico School District. “It’s a story not only of athletic accomplishment but also the importance of academic accomplishment.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I loved mathematics and I loved science,” Fosbury told the students. “I had to work at that.”  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fosbury also answered questions from the student audience and posed for pictures with students,<a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Captureabbing.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2688 alignright" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Captureabbing-300x250.jpg" alt="Fosbury" width="493" height="411" /></a> teachers and administrators, many of which have been posted to Facebook and Twitter.</span>

Congratulations Bay View. Thank you for raising the bar in PE.
