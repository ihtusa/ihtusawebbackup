JASPER — Hamilton County schools were recognized by Rikita Patel from the Florida Department of Health and Penny Taylor from the Florida Department of Education for being a healthy school on Monday.

The Florida Coordinated School Health Partnership (CSH) is a program which helps to determine the status of a school’s health. Hamilton County received the Silver Flag and award from CSH.
<div id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print">There are eight components for the CSH which consists of health education; physical education; health services; nutrition services; counseling, psychological, and social services; healthy school environment; health promotion for staff; and parent and community involvement. There were several places where the school gained large improvements.</div>

“Physical education, in 2013 you scored at 52 percent, this year 71 percent. In health education in 2013 you were at 32 percent, this year you were at 64 percent,” Taylor detailed the gains. “Employee wellness in 2013 you were at 46 percent, in 2017 you were at a remarkable 83 percent.”
<div id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print">The schools also received a check for $15,000 for Hamilton County Education Foundation.</div>
The members talked about the new start and end times for both schools and decided on starting at 8 a.m. to 3:01 p.m. for Hamilton County High School and starting at 8:10 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. for Hamilton County Elementary School.

The school board did not get the chance to discuss some of the items on the agenda due to Superintendent Rex Mitchell and Chairman Johnny Bullard being in Tallahassee. There will be a special meeting on July 24 at 4 p.m.
