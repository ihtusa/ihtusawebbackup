Yesterday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, <strong>adidas</strong> announced a new partnership with <strong>Interactive Health Technologies</strong> that will utilize modern technology to better empower young people in managing their health.

Pairing adidas’ miCoach technology with IHT’s heart rate monitoring system and customized curriculums in U.S. middle schools and high schools, the two parties aim to improve healthy living among America’s youth by setting individualized goals in PE for kids across the country. Last year, IHT connected 240,000 children to their program. In 2016, they hope to connect with one million students on a daily basis.

“When we started on this journey, we knew that there was a lot to be done in order to change the way that health is seen in the United States and beyond,” said Jen Ohlson, Co-Founder and President of IHT. ” We have already made great strides in developing a system that brings together exercise and academics in a program making a real difference.”

By teaming up with adidas, IHT has the ability to grow and innovate throughout the U.S. and far beyond. Early examples of the benefits of working with adidas included a monthly challenge program highlighted by a summer institute for physical education teachers that will connect more students to IHT heart rate technology than ever before.

“Our miCoach training system is all about unleashing the very best in human potential in a way that is simple and personalized through the use of heart rate,” said adidas Digital Sports VP and GM Stacey Burr. “We found our goals to be aligned with those of IHT and feel that the collaboration represents a fantastic opportunity to help thousands of school children achieve this. By bringing the adidas miCoach system together with IHT, we can help more young people unlock their potential leading to active and healthier lifestyles.”
