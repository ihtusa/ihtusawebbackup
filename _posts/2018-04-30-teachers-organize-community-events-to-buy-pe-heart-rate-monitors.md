<span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical education teachers use community events to showcase their program can also double as key fundraising events, helping purchase new instruments that can help students develop lifelong skills to manage their health and fitness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maize South Middle School (Kan.) PE teacher Brandon Wolff created his </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/maize-south-teacher-finds-bullish-solution-funding-challenge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bull Rush</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> event to inspire a renewed commitment to effort for his students to put in health-enhancing work during class.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things we saw a few years ago was that kids weren’t giving us any effort,” Wolff said. “They just got their fitness tests done without worrying about the score. We came up with the idea to do an obstacle course at the end of the year.”</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the PE teacher first introduced the idea to his students, they were intrigued. Then Wolff told them they needed to qualify to take part in the event by scoring well on the assessments that measure the five key health-related fitness elements in his curriculum:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscular strength</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscular endurance</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardiovascular endurance</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Body composition</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really wanted to find a challenge for them in all of these areas since those are the areas they are working on all year long,” Wolff said. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The inaugural event, held in 2015, saw 280 students earn the right to take part. Wolff and his colleagues created a course on the school’s grounds, with obstacles donated and sponsored by local businesses. Community members – parents, mostly – watched with awe as their children put their fitness on display. More than once, Wolff overheard encouraging feedback.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Bull Rush was such a huge success with our students,” Wolff said. “One of the biggest [pieces of] feedback we got from parents was, ‘man, I wish I could run in that.’ When I kept hearing that, I went to my co-worker and said, ‘I think we’ve got something here.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The feedback proved doubly important as Wolff needed to raise money to add PE heart rate monitors to his program. Wolff turned the next Bull Rush into a two-day community event. Students who qualified ran the course on Friday. On Saturday, interested community members paid $25 for the opportunity to run the course.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was huge for us,” Wolff said. “We raised about $3,000 for the public run. At the same time, a grant for $7,600 from our educational foundation came through. We were able to take all of that and put it toward heart rate monitors. We made it happen.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolff added the </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrist heart rate monitors, along with the</span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/spirit-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IHT Spirit System </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">software, to his program. Students wear the heart rate monitors during his PE classes and receive immediate feedback about their exertion levels. Wolff pushes students to exercise in their target heart rate zone for a set amount of time. Students can see which zone they are exercising in on their wrist, along with their heart rate. Following class, they automatically receive and email with a detailed report that includes:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A graph displaying their heart rate throughout the session</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minutes spent exercising in each heart rate zone and </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total time spent in the target heart rate zone</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bull Rush became Wolff’s signature community event. Other teachers have hosted their own fundraisers, some using the adidas Zone heart rate monitors, to raise funds for their programs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers in </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/indian-springs-uses-fitfest-for-pe-technology/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Antonio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/hendrickson-hosts-fitfest-fundraiser/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pflugerville</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Texas each hosted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT Fitfest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> events to add heart rate monitors to their curriculum, and more are scheduled for the Spring. On May 19, </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/fmhs-p-e-class-goes-high-tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fort Madison High School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Iowa) is holding a FitFest to raise money for additional heart rate monitors, and schools in Chicago and Colorado have events on tap in the coming weeks.</span>
