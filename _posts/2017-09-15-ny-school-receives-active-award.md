Active Schools, a national movement dedicated to ensuring 60 minutes of daily physical activity is the norm in K-12 schools, honored Clyde-Savannah Elementary School with <span style="color: inherit; font-size: inherit;">the 2017 </span>Let’s Move! Active Schools National Award for its efforts in creating an active school environment.

The award is the nation’s top physical education and physical activity distinction for K-12 schools, and celebrates a school’s commitment to providing students with at least 60 minutes a day of before, during and after school physical activity. Only 452 schools across the country received the award in 2017.

Congratulations to all involved."

Powered by a national collaborative of health, education and private sector organizations, Active Schools equips schools with the resources, programs, professional development and grants to increase physical education and physical activity opportunities for students, and cultivate an active school environment.

Regular physical activity not only helps kids stay healthy and strong, but it can also lead to higher test scores, improved attendance, increased focus, better behavior in class, enhanced leadership skills and a lifetime of healthy habits.

“We commend Clyde-Savannah Elementary School’s model work around enhancing physical education and physical activity opportunities and inspiring students to perform their best both in the classroom and in life,” said Charlene Burgeson, Active Schools executive director. “Clyde-Savannah Elementary is leading the way in this generation-changing movement that is transforming our nation’s schools into active and healthy hubs.“

To earn a Let’s Move! Active Schools National Award, a school must have met significant benchmarks in five areas: physical education, physical activity before and after school, physical activity during school, staff involvement and family and community engagement.
Clyde-Savannah Elementary School received a large display banner, National Award certificate and congratulatory letter as part of the Let’s Move! Active Schools National Award package.
