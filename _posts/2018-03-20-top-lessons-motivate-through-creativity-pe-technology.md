<span style="font-weight: 400;">From frisbee to circuit-based fitness, physical educators are using PE technology to teach students the long-term value of heart rate training in a variety of ways.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of our goal is to expose students to as many different activities and fitness exercises with the hope that it will transfer outside of the classroom and promote lifelong fitness,” said Kelly Spreen, a P.E. teacher at </span><a href="http://popl.ink/zP2MRh"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelburne Community School (Vermont)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the co-creator of one of the winning IHT Spirit Video Challenge lessons, “Fun, F.I.T.T.ness and Forever Strong.”</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with Spreen’s winning lesson, other IHT Spirit Video Challenge lessons include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fit for Life Tabata Circuit, Steve Boone</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distance Running Lesson, Kelly Rich and Meghan Enos</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Frisbee Fitness, Andy Pulling</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/fit-life-utilizes-hiit-principles-in-physical-education/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fit for Life Tabata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he created for students at Lunenburg (Mass.) High School, Boone reinforces what students are learning by incorporating PE technology. Students, both high schoolers during the day and adults in the evening wear </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrist heart rate monitors during their lessons and receive individualized reports detailing how much time they spent exercising in the target heart rate zone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been an unbelievable motivational thing for them,” Boone said of the heart rate monitors. “It pushed them. They check out their results after class. They have competitions between each other. A lot of time I have husbands and wives competing against each other and seeing who works out the hardest, who burns the most calories, making sure they get into the yellow and red zones and stay there. If they aren’t there, you’ll see them working harder.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Boone’s customizable Tabata circuit works equally well for his high school students and his adult education students, who meet in the evenings.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I try to incorporate [all] types of exercises in the Tabata workout,” he said. “It changes. It’s very fluid, and it’s all based on what the students want to get out of it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With his teens and adult students, Boone takes his cues from participants to modify the stations during each session. If adults want to work on certain fitness elements, he adds those stations. If a new station works particularly well with students during the school day, Boone might add it to the adult Tabata.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of the stuff I do with the adults in the night program are exercises that we tried during the day with the students,” he said. “If it goes well during the day, we’ll use that workout tonight and see how it works with the adults.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Spreen’s </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/adidas-lesson-creating-healthy-students-developing-fitness-passion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lesson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, created with colleagues Craig MacDerment, Mary Nelson and Jude Olson, tasks students with working together to complete a multi-faceted fitness circuit. While students strive to complete as many repetitions at each station as the can, the circuit also serves as a valuable tool to help students find exercises they could potentially continue into adulthood.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of our goal is to expose students to as many different activities and fitness exercises with the hope that it will transfer outside of the classroom and promote lifelong fitness,” Spreen said. “Starting in kindergarten and going through eighth grade, what are the things that we can be doing so that students can find what works for them so they can be physically active for life?”</span>

Currently, Spreen and MacDerment teach students to measure heart rate manually. They plan to add PE technology to measure heart rate in the fall.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/fast-paced-frisbee-focused-p-e-lesson-elevates-student-heart-rate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portland (Mich.) High School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Andy Pulling modified a backyard frisbee game to include heart rate-raising running in his winning adidas Lesson. Instead of Kan Jam’s original target concept, which doesn’t require much exercise, Pulling added 30-second circuits where students throw frisbees at targets and then sprint to change positions with partners. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“They just eat it up and don’t realize how hard they are working,” he said. “As a teacher I push them a little bit harder because I know they’re enjoying this activity. At the end of it, they’re sweating, they’re laughing, they’re enjoying it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers Kelly Rich and Meghan Enos designed a running unit that introduces their </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/superstar-p-e-lesson-helps-students-develop-skill-passion-for-running/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John T. Nichols Middle School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> students to distance running on the trails adjacent to schools. Measuring heart rate has become an integral part of their program as well. They hope to add IHT's PE technology in the new school year.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The teachers aren’t trying to create the next crop of marathoners. They want students to see the long-term health benefits of running to maintain their fitness level.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to get more life-long activities in our classes,” Enos said. “We want to help them find their niche, find activities they can participate in on their own time and develop more active lifestyles.”</span>
