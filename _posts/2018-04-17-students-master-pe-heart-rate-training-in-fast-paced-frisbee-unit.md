<span style="font-weight: 400;">A Michigan physical education teacher’s twist to a backyard game has his students maximizing their effort as they study PE heart rate training.</span>

<a href="http://popl.ink/u5SYrw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portland (Mich.) High School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PE teacher Andrew Pulling’s frisbee unit has emerged as one of his most popular – and taxing – units for students, despite the frisbee game’s laid-back reputation. Pulling modified a unit based on the backyard target game Kan-Jam to encourage students to exercise at an elevated heart rate.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The original game is just a back-yard game,” Pulling explained while introducing his </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/259028766"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fun Frisbee Fitness”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unit, a <a href="https://ihtusa.com/fast-paced-frisbee-focused-p-e-lesson-elevates-student-heart-rate/">standards-based unit</a> selected as a winner of the most recent </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/adidas-challenge-winners-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT Spirit Video Challenge Powered by adidas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It’s pretty laid back. We’ve added some agility to it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students pair up and must work on their frisbee-tossing accuracy while racing back and forth between stations. Pulling’s game works by:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting up a target at a specific distance;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One student throws the frisbee at the target, then sprints to change spots with a partner, teams accrue points by hitting the target with each toss;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students complete as many tosses as possible in a 30-second burst; then rest and repeat for as many reps as time allows in class.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the score of the game, Pulling said students have started focusing on PE heart rate training, ensuring they are meeting his goals for time spent exercising at an elevated rate. Students strive to get their heart rates up during the game, pausing every few rounds to manually measure their heart rate and check their zone. This year, Pulling’s helped reinforce that effort by adding </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrist heart rate monitors, enabling students to tie what they are feeling about their effort with an actual heart rate reading.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It gives students a completely different motivation,” Pulling said. “Rather than the score of a game, rather than who is doing what, now the motivation is really the self-motivation, the self-drive of ‘can I challenge myself to get into my [target heart rate] zone? And, ‘what can I do to keep it there?’”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling’s frisbee unit has grown over the years. At first, he simply worked on the basic skills of the social game, then realized he needed to develop a way to utilize PE heart rate training.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“At first we simply played the original game, and I noticed pretty quickly that, ‘man, there’s no fitness here,’” Pulling admitted. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two iterations later, Pulling’s created a doubly-effective game that his students look forward to playing while putting in the effort required to reach their target heart rate zone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“They just eat it up and don’t realize how hard they are working,” he said. “As a teacher I push them a little bit harder because I know they’re enjoying this activity. At the end of it, they’re sweating, they’re laughing, they’re enjoying it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, the teacher says, the students are reinforcing what they learn about the benefits of heart rate training.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do heart rate in a lot of different lessons, so when we get to this unit, they know how to do that and where they should be,” Pulling said. “In designing this, I wanted to give them something they could do with very little equipment, any time and do it with anybody. This is one of those activities.”</span>
