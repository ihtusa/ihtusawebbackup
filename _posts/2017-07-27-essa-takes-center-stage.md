<span style="font-weight: 400;">July 27, 2017 - A new era begins next month as the U.S. Department of Education focuses on a more well-rounded approach to student development under the Every Student Succeeds Act. Education leaders are keeping an eye on Washington, D.C. while the DoE works to approve each state’s plan for the first year under ESSA. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">ESSA becomes the nation’s public education standard with the arrival of the 2017-18 school year. Educators have one eye trained on ESSA’s implementation, the other on Congress as it deliberates over the DoE’s 2017-28 budget. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before federal funding is passed down, the DoE must review and accept each state’s education plan. A key element to states’ plans will be an explanation detailing how local districts will develop data to prove schools will deliver programs that fully prepare students for success both in college and their postgraduate careers. </span><!--more-->

From a physical education standpoint, we looked at how money previously available in competitive federal grants such as the Carol White Physical Education Program (PEP) grants would be distributed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, </span><a href="https://www.thechampioninitiative.com/single-post/2015/11/29/No-More-Savings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Champion Initiative’s Kathleen Satterley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stressed the importance for teachers to work closely with district officials to craft plans that could help state departments of education formulate their proposals and submit them to the U.S. Department of Education. With the bulk of that work heading toward completion, let’s take a look at the implementation of ESSA as currently sits.</span>
<h4><b>State ESSA Review Process</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://ed.gov/admins/lead/account/stateplan17/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> figures issued in May, only 17 states (including the District of Columbia) had submitted their ESSA plans for review. States have until Sept. 18 to submit their plans. The government then has 120 days to review and accept each plan. Each state’s plan should show how schools will meet the four basic tenets of ESSA:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold all students to high academic standards;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare all students for success in college and career; </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guarantee that steps are taken to help students, and their schools, improve; and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hold schools accountable for student outcomes</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in late 2016, local education leaders came together to formulate plans to submit to state leaders. State leaders weighed the different plans and crafted the best plan to submit to the Department of Education. Early feedback on plans that have been submitted to the Department of Education shows states are focusing on delivering a complete curriculum.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple state plans emphasized their intentions to provide well-rounded curriculums; ensuring students have increased access to high-quality science and social studies in addition to reading and mathematics,” Dr. Elizabeth Primas, the Educational Program Manager for ‎National Newspaper Publishers Association, wrote in the </span><a href="http://sdvoice.info/the-every-student-succeeds-act-focuses-on-accountability-and-school-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Diego Voice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on July 26. “In fact, more than half of submitted state plans include assessments for science and social studies in addition to the required English Language Arts, reading, and mathematics. Some states went as far as including fine arts, music, physical education, and library media specialists.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite ESSA’s mandate that the states set their own standards, the government has asked some to raise their standards or provide more detail in their plans. Some plans have been returned for revision by the Department of Education despite early indications that plans meeting the letter of the law would be approved, according to Education Week’s Alyson Klein’s reporting on June 21. Three states, including Delaware, saw their plans </span><a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/06/21/ed-dept-demands-more-detail-from-states.html?qs=essa+state+plans+" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kicked back for lack of detail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The messaging that the states had been hearing up to the submission point was there was no reason a plan would not have been approved," said Dale Chu, the vice president for policy and operations at America Succeeds, which works to get business involved in education. But this early feedback "wasn't as rubber-stampy as folks might have thought it would be.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 33 states that still need to file their plans may benefit from the early feedback by providing more detail, especially when it comes to reporting and measuring progress, Klein wrote.</span>
<h4><b>Finding funding</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 20, </span><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/teaching_now/2017/07/teachers_lobbying_capitol_hill.html?qs=ESSA+Implementation+daterange:2017-06-01..2017-07-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education Week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that a number of state teachers of the year journeyed to Washington to meet with their legislators to stress the importance of a fully-funded educational budget.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“On Wednesday, dozens of state teachers of the year were at the Capitol here, armed with talking points, compelling stories from their districts, and a fierce determination to protect education funding,” wrote Madeline Will. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If current projections hold, ESSA figures to represent about 25 percent of the total</span><a href="http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/07/19/k-12-panel-advances-budget-bill.html?qs=education+budget" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $66 billion education budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but that’s nearly $2 billion less than the 2016-17 budget, Education Week reported in mid-July.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Obama’s ESSA budget included $17 billion for programs that qualify under three criteria:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title 1: $16 billion for schools populated with high levels of low-income families. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title 2: $569 million provides funding for professional development of administrators, teachers and staff </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title 4: $1 billion to fund programs focusing on healthy schools, well-rounded education and technology.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While projections indicate that Title 1 will be fully funded again, educators fear that the overall decrease will impact the funding available under ESSA’s Title 2 funding. Budget approval is expected in advance of the Oct. 1 start of the government’s fiscal year.</span>
<h4><b>The funding funnel</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By consolidating funding formerly set aside in a number of competitive grants -- the PEP grants as a primary example -- ESSA changes the way local schools can request and compete for funding.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the education budget becomes final, the federal government will allocate funding to each state’s department of education based on the plans submitted and subsequently approved. Local schools will, in turn, apply to their state education agency for specific ESSA-allocated funding through, as schools in Texas must do, </span><a href="http://tea.texas.gov/About_TEA/News_and_Multimedia/Correspondence/TAA_Letters/2017%E2%80%932018_Every_Student_Succeeds_Act_(ESSA)_-_Consolidated_Federal_Grant_Application/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidated Grant Applications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. States will fund most grants based on need, particularly for Title 1 requests. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The new school year -- and formal implementation of the ESSA guidelines, are mere weeks away. IHT will continue to work with school officials from teachers to superintendents to discover the best way to deliver tools that can help students take advantage of a well-rounded education.</span>
