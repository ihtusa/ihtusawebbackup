<span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical education teachers faced with dwindling class time can expand their programs and recapture lost exercise time by integrating the IHT Spirit Mobile App into their use of the adidas Zone for IHT Spirit wrist heart rate monitors.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Developed and released in September 2017, the <a href="https://ihtusa.com/iht-spirit-mobile-app/">IHT Spirit Mobile App</a> enables teachers using the <a href="http://ihtusa.com/zone">adidas Zone wrist HRMs</a> to stay connected as students make up missed assignments or take on new assignments outside of their normal P.E. classes. While it’s inherently easier for classroom teachers to assign and verify completion of make-up assignments, physical educators have struggled.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It used to be that we’d send home a piece of paper with an assignment to make up and they’d sign it saying they did the workout, but you don’t really know,” said <a href="https://ihtusa.com/app-allows-active-option-make-missed-workout-time/">Riverton, Wy. P.E. teacher Mike Bradley</a>.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016-12-11_0680web.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8100" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2016-12-11_0680web-300x161.jpg" alt="App" width="300" height="161" /></a>During a normal class session, Bradley assigns a lesson and sets heart rate-based goals that students strive to achieve. Each student wears an adidas Zone HRM, which displays the student’s heart rate and heart rate zone (resting, moderate, vigorous) throughout the session. At the workout’s conclusion, students receive a summary via email that includes:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">total minutes spent exercising at an elevated heart rate; </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chart displaying heart rate throughout the session; and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how students performed compared to the teacher’s goal for the lesson.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Spirit Mobile App, Bradley can give students who miss a class session a Zone monitor to use on their own time and see their progress as they make up the assignment. The App activates the heart rate monitor and connects the student to the assignment. Upon completion, the student and teacher receive the same email summary as the students who completed the session during class.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the app will be beneficial with make-up time,” he said, adding that completing the assignment through the app allows the teacher to see the student’s data and provide any necessary coaching and feedback to help boost performance or reinforce the lesson. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With research proving the academic benefits of quality physical education and physical activity during the school day, Bradley’s looking for ways to minimize lost exercise time for his students.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think about it this way: if one of my students misses just one class, that’s 20 percent of their at-school exercise time for a week,” he said. “That’s huge. I would think we lose about 10 percent of our total workouts, and they can be made up.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He won’t settle for the alternative of allowing a student to miss valuable exercise time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want them to give up a workout day,” he said. “Now, you can send a [heart rate] monitor home and have them do it through their app. If for no other reason, that’s one day a kid didn’t’ take off from being active.”</span>
