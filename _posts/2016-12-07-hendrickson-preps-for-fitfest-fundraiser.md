Hendrickson High School will host the Hawk Nation IHT Spirit FitFest Sunday, a fundraiser to purchase heart-rate monitors and related software for the school’s physical education department.

The Hawk Nation FitFest features a 5K fun run, a Kids K and a health and wellness expo for the community. Organizers aim to raise money to purchase <a href="http://ihtusa.com/zone" target="_blank">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</a> wrist heart-rate monitors and the IHT Spirit System assessment software to enhance the school’s physical education department.<!--more-->

The new made-for-physical education heart-rate monitors allow students and teachers to track their progress in PE, teaching them to work out smarter and more efficiently both in class and throughout their lives. The <a href="http://ihtusa.com/spirit-system" target="_blank">IHT Spirit System</a> assesses the data from the monitors and delivers a personalized workout summary to each student immediately after PE class.

FitFest, done in conjunction with Austin-based Interactive Health Technologies, LLC, allows students to preview the monitors in action while raising money to purchase the monitors and software. The first 100 registered participants will wear the monitors during the run.

“Using student heart-rate data is the most accurate and impactful way to measure exercise intensity,” said IHT President and Co-Founder Jen Ohlson. “IHT is excited to offer Fit Fest as a fundraiser to provide the school and its community an opportunity to change students’ lives and have fun doing it.”

Online registration runs through Friday at <a href="http://runsignup.com/Race/TX/Pflugerville/adidasandIHTFitFest" target="_blank">runsignup.com/Race/TX/Pflugerville/adidasandIHTFitFest</a>. Registration prices are $20 individually or $60 for a Family Fun Pack (four registrations). Walk-up registrations will also be accepted at Hendrickson High School Sunday. The registration and check-in table opens at 11 a.m. and the fun run begins at 1 p.m.

<a href="http://www.pfisd.net/HHS" target="_blank">Hendrickson High School&nbsp;</a>is located at 19201 Colorado Sand Dr. in Pflugerville.
