The video received 4,071 votes and also drew high marks from judges based on the class’ creative efforts to “Raise the Bar” in its approach to physical education.

The grand prize includes a set of 28 new <a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone" target="_blank">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</a> heart-rate monitors and three years of IHT Spirit System software and training, a $3,000 gift card from adidas and a special school-wide pep rally featuring United States track and field legend <a href="https://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=57" target="_blank">Dick Fosbury</a>, whose innovated “Fosbury Flop” earned him the high jump gold medal in the 1968 Olympics. Fosbury, who announced the winner in a special video, will deliver the prizes in person this fall.

“We’re thrilled to be working with IHT to support PE teachers in their efforts to empower students to get and stay active,” said adidas Director of Partnerships Kim Scheffler. “Judging from the video submissions, especially the winning entry from Bay View Middle School, it’s clear there are some exemplary teachers and students worthy of recognition who are ‘raising the bar’ for physical education.”

Anderson Elementary first grader Mallory Greer won the top prize for a student-submitted video. Greer’s video provided a day-long look at how her class focuses on physical education, both at school and at home.

Greer wins an adidas Zone for IHT Spirit monitor and a $1,000 adidas gift card.

Judges considered videos based on three criteria: how well the video exemplified raising the bar in physical education (50 percent), creativity (25 percent) and voting results (25 percent). Voting results served as the tiebreaker.

This year’s PE video challenge, the second conducted by IHT, drew 50 entrants and more than 31,000 voters who looked at videos nearly 63,000 times.

“Every video exemplified how teachers and students across the country demonstrate leadership, passion and quality physical education every single day,” said IHT president Jen Ohlson. “Each video inspired not only our judges but everyone who viewed them. As a company we are extremely proud to work with so many amazing physical education programs.”

That turnout dwarfs the company’s first challenge, conducted in 2015. That contest drew 24 video entries and 16,507 voters who looked at videos nearly 28,000 times. Last year’s most popular video earned 3,200 votes. This year, nine videos received at least 1,000 votes, up from four in 2015.
