<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I relate the use of heart rate technology in physical education to Chromebooks for classroom teachers,” said Everitt Middle School (JeffCo Public Schools, Colo.) physical education teacher Bradley Hull. “It is absolutely essential for instruction. My number one philosophy as a PE teacher is for students to take what they learn in class outside of class so they can become lifelong movers.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, the Colorado legislature passed the </span><a href="https://www.cde.state.co.us/dataprivacyandsecurity/dplaw-districts" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Data Transparency and Security Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a law that requires technology companies to meet specific conditions before a school can partner with them. For Hull, the change meant he had to immediately stop using heart rate monitors he’d already purchased. When the company Hull originally partnered with failed to receive approved vendor status, the teacher had to find another company whose security practices met the state’s standards. </span><!--more-->

<b>Navigating Colorado’s technology requirements</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I reached out to Dave Yonkie, </span><a href="https://jeffco.ss12.sharpschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JeffCo Public Schools’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Physical Education Curriculum Coordinator, to see if he had any recommendations for me to look into regarding a vendor I can try that would meet requirements of this new Colorado law,” he said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hull evaluated heart rate monitors from several manufacturers and determined that the </span><a href="http://ihtusa.com/zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> monitors and accompanying <a href="https://ihtusa.com/spirit-system/assessment-software/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Assessment Measures software</a> fit his program the best. Hull worked with his administration and IHT to decipher and adhere to Colorado’s new standards and received permission to purchase and utilize the <a href="http://ihtusa.com/spirit-system">IHT Spirit System</a>® components.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The vetting process took months and the new law places many restrictions on teachers when it comes to using technology with student information,” Hull said, “but IHT worked with us throughout the entire process and met every condition.”</span>

<b>Adding technology that motivates students</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Five classes of students at </span><a href="http://everitt.jeffcopublicschools.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everitt Middle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have worn the Zone monitors since October. In March, a group of students participating in an after-school cycling program will also track their heart rate during rides while wearing the heart rate monitors. Hull tested the Zone HRMs last May to be more familiar with them when the new school year began. His Zone test justified the subsequent purchase and motivated his students.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I could tell that it would instantaneously increase motivation for students to be in PE as well,” he said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hull’s PE program drives his JeffCo students to take what they learn beyond the school walls, and the adidas Zone heart rate monitors will help reinforce daily lessons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“They can see their own heart rate, and with IHT’s monitors, they can see the color on their wrist and that way they know themselves if they are working at a proper intensity,” he said. “It also teaches individual ownership of their learning as well.”</span>

<b>Utilizing JeffCo colleagues to find funding</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology comes at a cost, and Hull spends a portion of each week seeking out and talking with his administrative team about grants he can apply to receive. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I work at a Title 1 school which makes me want to apply for as many grants as possible,” he said. “Anything that I think I might have a chance for, I apply.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He subscribes to a monthly email distributed by the JeffCo grants department and routinely meets with his administrative team, including Principal Jeff Gomez, Yonkie and members of the district’s </span><a href="https://jeffco.ss12.sharpschool.com/services/health_services/healthy_schools" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthy Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Play 60 departments. Those meetings, in addition to finding funding opportunities, serve as a chance for Hull to prove the value of the innovative technology he wants to add to his program.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our huge focuses school-wide is innovation,” he said. “Anything with technology, our administration is all over because it helps embed innovation in the school. In my opinion heart rate monitors are by far the most innovative tool any physical educator could use.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hull’s been particularly successful, applying for and winning funds that have shaped Everitt’s P.E. during the 2017-18 school year. With help from his administration, Hull has secured: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a pair of </span><a href="https://www.fueluptoplay60.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NFL Fuel Up to Play 60</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grants totaling nearly $4,200 in the last two years;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Healthy Schools grant that provided the funding to purchase the class set of adidas Zone monitors from IHT; </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new $100,000 </span><a href="https://www.colorado.gov/governor/news/three-colorado-schools-selected-national-don%E2%80%99t-quit-fitness-center-winners" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t Quit!”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fitness center awarded through the National Foundation of Governors’ Fitness Councils; and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a </span><a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/specialized-foundation-school-program-grant" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riding For Focus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grant from The Specialized Foundation, which will provide the school with 25 new mountain bikes and helmets.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students utilize the heart rate monitors when exercising in the new center. Hull’s excited for the students who will participate in the cycling program to benefit from the Zone’s unlimited data recording range, which allows for long-distance use. Hull’s grateful for the support he received in the grant application process - Assistant Principal Tim Carlin helped lead the effort to secure the Riding For Focus Grant - and that the JeffCo administration understands the value of his program.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very passionate and it helps that I have a supporting administration,” he said. “They see the value and importance of exercise and how it helps students stay out of trouble and helps them in the classroom. I’m just thankful I have a supportive administration that trusts what I do and what I have to say.”</span>
