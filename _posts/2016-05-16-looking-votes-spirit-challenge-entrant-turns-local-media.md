You won’t catch Falls River, Mass., physical education teacher Terry Mahjoory talking about the demise of newspaper.

The Sylvia School teacher let the local paper, the Herald News, know about her elementary school class’ entry into the Interactive Health Technologies “Raising the Bar” PE Video Challenge sponsored by Adidas.

<!--more-->As of Sunday, when the article written by Greg Sullivan published on the <a href="http://www.heraldnews.com/article/20160515/NEWS/160517149">Herald News</a> website, Sylvia School’s entry sat in second place, about 700 votes behind the weekend leader Bay View Middle School in Green Bay, Wisc., by approximately 700 votes. By Monday afternoon, the gap had closed to 600 votes.

“If we can get those 700 votes, we can win this thing,” Sylvia School Principal Jean Facciano said in Sullivan's story.

Winning would be a big deal to Sylvia, or any of the other 36 entrants. The winning video, determined by popular vote count and a panel of judges at IHT, gives its school a prize package that includes a class set (30) of the Adidas Zone for IHT Spirit monitors, three years of free software usage and all of the training necessary to get started. The winners also get a pep rally complete with a visit from 1968 Olympic Gold Medal high-jumper Dick Fosbury, who revolutionized the sport with his innovative style.

Voting wraps up Friday, May 20. Individuals may vote up to five times total for their favorite video.

The IHT Spirit System uses the Adidas Zone for IHT Spirit heartrate monitor, worn on its user’s wrist, to provide real-time data about how closely the wearer is exercising in his optimal heart rate zone. The easy-to-read data has PE teachers excited about possibilities.

“’Their software is awesome for assessment in PE,’ Mahjoory said in a Facebook message to this reporter,” wrote Sullivan.
