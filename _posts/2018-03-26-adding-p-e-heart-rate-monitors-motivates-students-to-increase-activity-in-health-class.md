<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fort Lupton (Colo.) Middle School teacher </span><a href="http://popl.ink/A9gpRm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsay Yost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uses P.E. heart rate monitors to maximize the effort her students put forth during activity breaks in her health classroom.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The once-and-future physical education teacher and mountain biking champion gets her health students up for several activity breaks and active-learning sessions during her 42-minute class period. Yost uses a variety of tools to make sure students take any opportunity to maintain or even improve their fitness levels.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve missed being active,” she said, sensitive to what students feel after being in a classroom period after period. “It’s interesting, too. My own fitness levels have declined because I’m in the classroom all day.”</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So Yost makes sure her students experience some activity in her class. Taking the school student council’s philosophy to heart, Yost uses several tools to get students moving:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fit Sticks</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit wrist heart rate monitors</span></a></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, she said, have always enjoyed the activity breaks and active lessons, but the recent addition of the heart rate monitors has boosted student engagement to new levels.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“My experience from when I used to be in a gym as the P.E. teacher to now as a health teacher, I have been telling my former partner, who’s now an assistant principal at the school, because whenever him and I taught PE at the same time, I told him that the </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/students-motivated-by-heart-rate-monitor-technology-during-pe/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy-in and effort levels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are 180 degrees different,” she said. “The kids are understanding.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yost gets students moving a variety of ways, mostly in quick bursts of activity designed to get heart rates up quickly and briefly – similar to a high intensity interval training workout – before moving to the next part of her lesson. Fit Sticks, purchased through the school’s Fuel Up to Play 60 initiative, allows students to choose an activity that the class participates in, making the most of the space beside their desks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“For instance, one minute of doing scissor jumps, throwing a crumpled-up piece of paper 10 times with each arm, 20 side-to-side skier jumps, lunging side to side, walk like a monkey for one minute, freeze dance until the music stops,” she said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The teacher utilizes music as a motivator as well. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I use music in my classroom all the time,” she said. “It doesn’t matter if I’m using it during physical activity or as a timer to say you have three minutes to write on a specific topic. If we do a one minute break, we’ll stop the music after one minute and they have to do that activity the entire time. Sometimes, we’ll even do a quick line dance that is pretty popular. I’ll pull up the video and we’ll follow along and do the dance.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While students surely benefit from every bit of activity they get in Yost’s class, the biggest benefit, she says, comes from learning the value of a </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/spirit-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heart rate monitor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and what it teaches everyone about their workout.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The kids having this technology so young is very exciting,” Yost said. “They’ll be able to take that knowledge and use it as an adult. Whether they are trying to run a 5K or cycling or doing triathlons or playing a pickup basketball game, whatever it may be, as an adult, having the knowledge and the desire to know how a heart rate monitor works will be a huge skill set that they can carry on with them.”</span>
