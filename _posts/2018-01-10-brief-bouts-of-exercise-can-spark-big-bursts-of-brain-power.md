Just 10 minutes of aerobic exercise can improve executive function by <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at priming" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/priming">priming</a> parts of the brain used to laser focus on the task at hand, according to a new study. This paper, “<a class="ext" href="http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0028393217304591" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executive-Related Oculomotor Control Is Improved Following a 10-minute Single-Bout of Aerobic Exercise: Evidence from the Antisaccade Task</a>,” was published in the January 2018 issue of <em>Neuropsychologia</em>.

This research was conducted by <a class="ext" href="http://www.uwo.ca/fhs/kin/people/faculty/heath_m.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Heath</a>, who is a kinesiology professor and supervisor in the Graduate Program in <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at Neuroscience" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/neuroscience">Neuroscience</a> at the University of Western Ontario, along with UWO master’s student Ashna Samani.

For this study, Samani and Heath asked a cohort of healthy young adults to either sit quietly and read magazines or perform 10 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) on a stationary bicycle. (MVPA aerobic intensity is hard enough that you might break a sweat but easy enough that you can carry on a conversation.)

Immediately after the 10-minute reading task or time spent doing aerobic exercise, the researchers used eye-tracking equipment to gauge antisaccades, which is a way to measure varying degrees of executive control.

As the authors explain in the study abstract, “Antisaccades are an executive task requiring a goal-directed eye movement (i.e., a <a class="ext" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=saccades+bergland+psychology+today&amp;rlz=1CASMAI_enUS730US732&amp;oq=saccades+bergland+psychology+today&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.6843j1j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saccade</a>) mirror-symmetrical to a visual stimulus. The hands- and language-free <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at nature" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/environment">nature</a> of antisaccades coupled with the temporal precision of eye-tracking technology make it an ideal tool for identifying executive performance changes.”

Previous research reported that 20 minutes (or more) of MVPA improved task-specific activity within frontoparietal networks of the brain and produced a short-term boost in executive-related <a class="inline-links topic-link" title="Psychology Today looks at cognitive" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/cognition">cognitive</a> control. However, the new findings from UWO suggest that executive-related brain benefits can kick in after just 10 minutes of aerobic exercise.

"Some people can't commit to a long-term exercise regime because of time or physical capacity," Matthew Heath said in a statement. "This shows that people can cycle or walk briskly for a short duration, even once, and find immediate benefits."

"I always tell my students before they write a test or an exam or go into an interview — or do anything that is cognitively demanding — they should get some exercise first," Heath emphasizes. "Our study shows the brain's networks like it. They perform better.”

Matthew Heath and colleagues at Western's <a class="ext" href="http://www.uwo.ca/bmi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brain and Mind Institute</a> are currently conducting a study to determine exactly how long the executive-related cognitive benefits of a 10-minute aerobic workout last after finishing a short bout of MVPA.
