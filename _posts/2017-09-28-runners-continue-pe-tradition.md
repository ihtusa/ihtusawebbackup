MINIER — Every student at Olympia West Elementary School got their blood pumping Wednesday.

<div class="subscriber-preview">
<p class="">Each grade level took turns lining up outside the school in Minier to run the mile for physical education class. The biannual run has turned into a much-anticipated tradition for students and their families.</p>
<p class="headline">Rusty Richards of Minier joined the spectators to support his three elementary students.</p>

</div>
<div id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"> “I like to attend their activities so they know I’m here for them,” said Richards. “The run gives my kids a healthy sense of family, pride and confidence. The school goes the extra mile by inviting everyone out to cheer for their kids.”</div>

<p class="">At the bang from a starting gun, a line of second-graders bolted across the grass in a park near the school. The 1-mile route lead the group along a cornfield and around the perimeter of Minier Cemetery.</p>

<p class="">Danica Hemphill of Armington waited for her second-grade twins, Wesley and Colton, to complete the run.</p>

</div>

<p class="">“They’ve been very excited for this,” she said. “<a class="" href="http://www.pantagraph.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/take-a-walk-activity-key-to-kids-health-during-summer/article_ed688ae3-97b2-578c-82c9-07b437e27c2d.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">They practiced at home by running around the block. I’m glad it encourages them to get exercise and practice healthy lifestyles.</a>”</p>

<p class="">PE teacher Peggy Braffet has led the event for 10 years. She begins preparing students for the run during the first week of school. The students run once in the fall and again in the spring.</p>

</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">Braffet said nearly 50 percent of the students who join athletics in Olympia’s junior high and high school programs are graduates of Olympia West and participants in the mile run event.</p>

</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">“They aren’t competing against each other, they’re competing against themselves to do a little better each time. It’s a big accomplishment for them to beat their previous times,” said Braffet.</p>

</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">Olympia West Principal Lisa Castleman said the event instills habits of training and exercising.</p>

</div>
<div class="tnt-ads-container text-center"> “Most kids were excited and some were nervous, but all of them were empowered by practice and their aim to achieve a goal,” said Castleman.</div>

<p class="">Soon, the first wave of runners came streaming around the final corner with red cheeks, arms and legs pumping hard. Spectators cheered as each student crossed the finish line where their final time was recorded.</p>

</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">Graham Walters, 8, was the third student to cross the line in just under 7½ minutes.</p>

</div>
<div id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"> “I always try to do my best,” said Graham. “When you run, it’s important to keep breathing so you can go a little faster.”</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">His mom, Mercedes Walters of Delavan, and grandparents Alice and Terry Ellis of Bloomington, congratulated Graham after the run.</p>

</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">“<a class="" href="http://www.pantagraph.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/good-advice-cut-flu-risk-with-steps/article_20c173c8-45f5-53ee-8c2d-1da45be34858.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Health is a really important thing for him</a>,” said Walters. “It’s awesome that so many parents came out to support their students.”</p>

<p class="">Tamra Schmidgall of Hopedale gave her granddaughter, Ava Jenkins, a proud squeeze after she caught her breath from finishing in 11th place.</p>

</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">“Even if you don’t think you got the best place, you still tried your best. I practiced for the run at home. Me and my sister did racing challenges outside,” said Ava, 7.</p>

</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">Schmidgall said she enjoyed seeing all the students “give it all they’ve got.”</p>

</div>
<div class="subscriber-only">
<p class="">“<a class="" href="http://www.pantagraph.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/fitness-program-reaches-people-with-disabilities/article_0d02d04b-435f-5732-ab21-cd2439f72720.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">You can tell they all have this huge sense of accomplishment, no matter how they did</a>," said Schmidgall. "I want my granddaughters to finish today with a sense of, ‘I did this. I can run the mile. I did my best.’”</p>
