Additionally, each winning lesson receives four <a href="http://ihtusa.com/zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</a> wrist heart rate monitors configured to be used in conjunction with the new <a href="http://ihtusa.com/iht-spirit-mobile-app">IHT Spirit Mobile App</a>. The mobile app allows teachers to assign and manage make-up work and other homework that students can complete away from their school P.E. classroom.

Teachers submitted plans for lessons that exemplified three stripes of superstar qualities: students working hard exercising at an elevated heart rate; life lessons that positively impact students; and standards-based lessons that can be adapted to all abilities. Judges selected the six lessons that best exemplified those standards.

“IHT is committed to empowering students, through guidance from the physical education teacher, to take ownership of improving their overall health and physical fitness,” said IHT President Jen Ohlson. “By sharing the best of the lessons entered in the Fall Spirit Challenge, we can help teachers reach more students with lessons that have proven to be both motivating and  effective.”

Each month’s lesson will also include a video detailing the lesson and a blog featuring an in-depth look at the teachers and how they designed and implement each workout. Teachers also receive adidas gear from IHT.

December’s adidas lesson will be released this week. Subsequent winning lessons will be released on the first Wednesday of each month.
