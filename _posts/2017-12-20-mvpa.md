Oct. 5, 2017 - Different companies have different philosophies about the key metrics in evaluating exercise sessions. There are devices the measure exercise at an elevated heart rate, how many steps we have taken, how fast we have run a given distance, and how many calories we have burned.

IHT designed the <a href="ihtusa.com/spirit-system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Spirit System</a> to focus on minutes of exercise because academic research on both children and adults shows conclusively that exercise at an elevated heart rate is correlated to increased longevity, <a href="https://ihtusa.com/muscular-fitness-enhances-cognitive-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">improved cognitive performance</a>, and self-regulation and classroom functioning among children.

We believe that people young and old, students or adults, see the biggest health benefit from exercising at an elevated heart rate and that research on other measures do not show the same reliability and efficacy as heart rate training.

To help students get in tune with their bodies, develop healthy habits, and understand what exercising at an elevated heart rate feels like, we partnered with <a href="www,adidas.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">adidas</a> to create the <a href="ihtusa.com/zone" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</a>, a heart rate monitor that can easily show students of all ages information they can use to improve their exercise performance. The Spirit System simplifies heart rate training to two zones of elevated heart rate exercise, yellow and red. Teachers using the Spirit System set daily class goals that focus on encouraging students to put forth enough effort to reach those zones and stay there for as long as they can.

“I focus on heart rate, and here’s why,” explains Wyoming middle school P.E. teacher Mike Bradley. “I can walk 10,000 steps in a day without getting my heart rate up, and we have to get our heart rates up for those steps to really benefit us. If you get your heart rate up often enough, then you’re helping your overall health and fitness.”

From a physiological standpoint, exercising at an elevated heart rate allows blood to more efficiently deliver much-needed nutrients and oxygen to muscles. The heart becomes stronger as it works harder, improving its health over time and lowering the risk of cardiac disease. Additionally, more and more studies detail how improved fitness helps fuel academic and cognitive development, as researched by <a href="https://ihtusa.com/quality-pe-sparks-academic-readiness/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Learning Readiness PE developers Paul Zientarski and Phil Lawler</a>. By improving their fitness, we are helping deliver students who are primed for academic success.
