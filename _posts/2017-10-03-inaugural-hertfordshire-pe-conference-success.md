An inaugural Teaching and Learning conference was hailed a “major success” as more than 80 teachers gathered to discuss physical education.

The Herts Secondary Schools PE Teaching and Learning Conference was held at the University of Hertfordshire, in Hatfield, on Monday, September 18, and was organised by the Herts Sports Partnership in conjunction with the Youth Sport Trust.

John O’Callaghan, partnership director of the Herts Sports partnership said: “Physical Education and sport within secondary schools is facing some real challenges – particularly with greater priority now being given to GCSE PE examination results.

“Ensuring that pupils have a very positive experience around PE is an essential building block in creating a sporting habit for life, and in promoting active lifestyles.

"The conference demonstrated once again, the quality of the PE teaching workforce in Hertfordshire and as the County Sports Partnership, we are committed to supporting their work as we fully appreciate the essential role played by these teaching professionals each and every day of the week.”
