AKRON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Smithers Apex is pleased to announce that Wearable Technology UX will be held in the US in 2015, after a highly successful and inspirational event in London last year. Taking place October 1-2, 2015 in Seattle, Washington, Wearable Technology UX is the only user experience event exclusively dedicated to the relationship between humans and wearable technology. Going beyond the hardware, this year’s program will focus specifically on gaining inspiration and keeping the user in mind when creating the next generation of wearables.
