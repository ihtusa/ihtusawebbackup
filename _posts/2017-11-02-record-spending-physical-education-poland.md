Poland’s government will set aside a record budget for physical education next year, officials have said.

Spending is expected to total PLN 1.24 billion (EUR 290 million, USD 350 million), growing by almost 13 percent from this year.

According to Sports Minister Witold Bańka, increased expenditure shows that the government pays a lot of attention to physical education and sports.
