<h2><b>IDEA College Prep creates new physical education program to combat childhood obesity</b></h2>
<b>BY PATRICK CHALVIRE WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16TH 2016</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It's well known that obesity and diabetes cases are high in the valley. A big way to help lower those numbers is getting young children involved in a healthy lifestyle early on. One valley school is doing just that and its already helping save lives.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A year ago, seventh-grader Mariel Lugo weighed 240 pounds and was pre-diabetic.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her uncle began to train her every day, around the same time IDEA College Prep San Juan implemented a new physical education program.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"We decided to go with a non-traditional sport aspect, just go get everyone a fair chance at playing and with that came the exercise,” said PE Teacher Erny Gutierrez.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the routine similar to CrossFit, the school brought in Interactive Health Technologies Spirit. Partnered with Adidas, IHT introduces grade schools students to the tools and resources to a healthier lifestyle.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A computer monitors a student’s progress, allowing teachers to efficiently track each of the students' performance in PE class.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">"They begin to see it themselves and they no longer need the motivation. They understand like, 'Wow. I am doing something and it is working and in the long run I’m gonna benefit from this," said PE Teacher Luis Guardiola.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 3,000 children in the Valley are classified as Type 2 diabetic, according to the South Texas Juvenile Diabetes Association. More than 1,700 are classified as Type 1.</span>
