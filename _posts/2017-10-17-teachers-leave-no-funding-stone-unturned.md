<span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding for new school initiatives including technology can be challenging, but creative teachers continue to find ways to help raise money by advocating for their needs, including staging community events that bring stakeholders together for a common cause.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, IHT and partner adidas combined to launch the </span><a href="http://ihtusa.com/fitfest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT Spirit FitFest powered by adidas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. FitFest is a “fundraiser in a box” program that helps schools host community-wide events designed to raise awareness for the physical education program and, more directly, money to purchase PE technology including the </span><a href="http://ihtusa.com/zone" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrist heart rate monitor. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“IHT and adidas help you every step of the way,” said Indian Springs Elementary School PE teacher Tracie Hammond, who organized a </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/hendrickson-hosts-fitfest-fundraiser/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FitFest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> event at her school in 2017. “They set you up with all of your supplies, everything you need to have a successful event.”</span><!--more-->

<h4><b>Tools for Community Showcase</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools that opt to host a FitFest event receive support that includes the following supplies:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand-up banners to mark the event;</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bibs for participants to wear during race-style events;</span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prizes for students who bring in the most pledges or funds; and </span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 adidas Zone monitors to use during the FitFest. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT also provides logistical support along the way, working with the organizing teacher or committee chairman to make sure the event comes off smoothly, and successfully and setting up an online event entry site to track registrations and pledge-raising.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In choosing to hold a FitFest, schools can decide on the type of event that works best in their specific community. At </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/hendrickson-hosts-fitfest-fundraiser/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hendrickson High School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outside of Austin, Texas, organizers opted for a weekend community 5K and Kids K accompanied by a health fair. At Indian Springs, Hammond felt an obstacle-course style event during each PE class period would work best.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Parents came and helped throughout the day,” Hammond said. “We had a silent auction for people to bid on so we can raise money to get the heart rate monitors so kids can wear them every day.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Hendrickson, the first 100 entrants in the 5K got to wear the adidas Zone heart rate monitors and the fundraising effort proved successful.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were able to raise more than our annual PE budget for the high school,” said Hendrickson assistant principal Nikki Dickerson, who also served as the volunteer chairman for the event. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At Indian Springs, each student got to wear a heart rate monitor during their time on the obstacle course. Hammond raised enough money to buy enough heart rate monitors for every PE student to wear in every class.</span>
<h4><b>Accessing Departmental Budgets</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers have become adept at exploring every funding opportunity, from the school’s technology budget to local education foundations to community-minded service organizations looking to fund worthwhile causes. The search for funding doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Other funding sources include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local insurance or health-based industries, who often provide money through direct requests or grant applications;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National insurance or health and fitness-based industries, such as NFL Fuel Up to Play 60;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">School systems have departments tasked with letting teachers know about different local, state and federal grants for which they can apply. </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/west-des-moines-schools-switch-heart-rate-technology/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">West Des Moines, Iowa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Brian Rhoads lobbied his administration for funding available through the district’s curriculum budget. He made his case by comparing the heart rate monitors to textbooks and providing the administration with every piece of relevant data on the benefits the heart rate monitors would provide his students, including data on how healthy students are more likely to find academic success.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must continue to create awareness of what we are doing to benefit students academically, socially and emotionally, and the like,” Rhoads said. “We have to get that in front of everyone. The community needs to know what’s going on in the program. If you don’t share the information [and the data], they won’t know.”</span>
<h4><b>Leaving no stone unturned </b></h4>
<a href="http://www.thekansan.com/news/20171006/elementaries-to-add-tech-to-pe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newton, Kansas, teacher Mario Nava</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hosted community events at both of the elementary schools where he teaches, applied for several grants and even hosted a garage sale to raise enough money to fund his purchase. The effort paid off: Nava raised enough to put adidas Zone monitors on his students at both Sunset and Northridge elementary schools as early as next month.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“They can see how active they were,” Nava said. “It is a learning tool for students to see how important it is to stay healthy and maintain an active lifestyle — not just while you are young but as you get older.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The study of heart rate – and the academic and health benefits of exercising at an elevated heart rate – continues to grow. Teachers work tirelessly to find funding that allows them to give students access to technology that can set them on the path to a healthy life, and IHT will continue to support them in this endeavor.</span>
