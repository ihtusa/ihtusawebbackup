<span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools that provide quality physical education are seeing the benefits well beyond student fitness levels. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The IDEA Public School network saw five of its Texas-based high schools earn rankings among the country’s most challenging high schools. Teachers in Nevada and Iowa are working to prove the direct correlation between improved physical fitness and academic performance.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, students wear heart rate monitors such as the </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrist heart rate monitor while they exercise during their physical education classes. Teachers then analyze the data through IHT’s </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/spirit-system/assessment-software/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assessment Measures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> software, where they gauge each student’s individual performance based on that day’s goal for time spent exercising at an elevated heart rate. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At IDEA Public Schools, five high school campuses that put a priority on helping students achieve Center for Disease Control-recommended minimums of physical activity per week were honored for academic achievement by the </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/idea-schools-thrive-academically/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WAshoe5.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-8036" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/WAshoe5-171x300.jpg" alt="academic" width="350" height="615" /></a>“When our leadership invested in IHT’s technology, that was the commitment that physical activity is a primary factor in how we’re going get our kids to be able to grow to success as they head into the real world,” said Eren Kirksey, IDEA’s PE Curriculum Manager.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students at every IDEA campus, including the five schools ranked in the top nine of the Washington Post’s list of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/local/high-school-challenge-2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">America’s Most Challenging High Schools,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wear the adidas Zone monitors during their physical education classes. Not only are students working daily to improve their fitness, they score highly on Advanced Placement exams – four of the campuses recognized by the Washington Post saw at least 76 percent of students passing an AP exam and two campuses saw 89 percent of students pass at least one exam.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">IDEA Schools recognized by the Washington Post include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frontier College Prep – 3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mission College Prep – 4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Juan College Prep – 5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Benito College Prep – 6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quest College Prep – 9th</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The end game of what we’re talking about is making the most academically sound kids, but there is a danger to not being able to work out,” Kirksey said. “As they get into college, we are starting to understand that not being able to work out, be recreationally active … plays a real big factor in how successful they are going to be.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to setting up fitness-based assessments, teachers can include academic benchmarks as well and track student improvement throughout a semester as fitness improves.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our objective is to have the students wear the heart rate monitors for at least 20 minutes twice a week,” said Pine Middle School (Reno, Nev.) P.E. teacher Jencie Fagan. “Then we will link their fitness improvements with their Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) scores.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fagan and seven Washoe Public School District colleagues tracked middle and high school students over the 2017 fall semester. Preliminary results, Fagan said, looked promising.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Iowa, P.E. teacher Elizabeth Luck added the element of personalized learning to her teaching, allowing students to devise and guide lessons that improve their long-term fitness while she monitored their academic progress, specifically in classes that follow physical education.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“[We expect] that more active students will see higher achievement in the classroom,” Luck said.  “Students who have physical education before a tough class should be able to go in and focus better after being active.”</span>
