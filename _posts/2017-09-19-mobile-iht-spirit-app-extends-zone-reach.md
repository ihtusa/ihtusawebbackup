<span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span>Tuesday, Sept. 19<span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2017, IHT released its newest tool to further personalize physical education for every student: the IHT Spirit Mobile App.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The new mobile app, available as a free download through the Google Play and iOS App stores, enables users to take part in physical education classes and workouts connected to the <a href="http://ihtusa.com/spirit-system">IHT Spirit System®</a> outside of the traditional school day and classroom. By controlling their adidas Zone for IHT Spirit wrist heart rate monitors on their mobile phones, students connect back to classroom workouts or track workouts they design themselves.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT worked closely with adidas to develop a mobile app that takes the monitors beyond the classroom. A growing number of students </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ulfill their physical education requirement outside of the traditional classroom setting. More than </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2012/2012008.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55 percent of U.S. school systems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer students the opportunity to take physical education as part of a virtual learning program.</span><!--more-->
<h4><b><a href="https://vimeo.com/231715870"><img class="wp-image-5942 alignright" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/App-newsletter-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="App" width="650" height="433" /></a>Virtual PE and IHT Spirit</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students can make up missed PE classes, extend the classroom to home, or opt for a virtual PE class to allow themselves more time during the school day to focus on other classes. IHT’s new mobile app allows students to participate fully in a PE class while doing it outside of the traditional confines of the school building. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we look at factors that have increased human performance over time, the key factors revolve around learning how to do things better, putting those lessons into practice, and getting feedback,” said IHT co-founder and CEO Ben Bentzin. “Feedback from an experienced coach - in the world of physical education, the teacher or trainer - reinforces to students what they need to do to keep improving.”</span>
<h4><b>Active Homework</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The IHT Spirit Mobile App benefits students who take PE in the traditional classroom setting as well. Teachers can assign active homework or extra credit for students to complete away from school or allow students who may not have met that day’s goal for minutes of Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity. They’d simply need their adidas Zone monitor and the app to complete the assignment when it best fits into their schedule.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By allowing students to use the Zone monitors with the App away from campus, teachers will know when the assignment is complete when they see the student’s activity inside the class Spirit System accounts.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT’s mission remains to help teachers empower students to own their physical fitness well beyond their school years. Pairing easily understandable heart rate monitors with teachers to explain the data and help develop healthy habits is the start of that process. Enabling students to maintain that personal connection to their fitness by using their mobile phones is the next crucial step along that journey.</span>
<h4><b><a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apps.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5935" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/apps-1024x695.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="441" /></a>PE is a vital part of a child’s education</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT believes that physical education is a vital tool to helping students improve not only their fitness but their academic performance as well. Many studies have proven the direct relationship between physical fitness and academic performance. Examples include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ihtusa.com/muscular-fitness-enhances-cognitive-improvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shih-Chun Kao’s study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the impact of muscular fitness on cognitive performance</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ihtusa.com/quality-pe-sparks-academic-readiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning Readiness PE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s program provides data showing students increasing literacy and math results when attending class immediately after PE</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2omCRUhyabXYTExaVJMMTEwcXc/view?pref=2&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action Based Learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s report outlining benefits of quality physical education</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017-01-27_1905-e1489191552993-1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3200" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017-01-27_1905-e1489191552993-1.jpg" alt="2017 01 27_1905" width="300" height="349" /></a>With the IHT Spirit System®, teachers load lessons and goals into their Spirit System groups, and students can access those groups, run workouts, receive reports and journal just as they would in class. From the convenience of their phone, students can access lesson materials and review the activity’s main objectives. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The model also works for families who Homeschool their children. Most </span><a href="https://www.responsiblehomeschooling.org/policy-issues/current-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">states require</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that students educated inside the home take part in a certified curriculum and many of those include physical education components. </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/who-we-serve/distance-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families interested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in heart rate training can utilize the IHT Spirit System® in the same way traditional schools can. </span>
<h4><b>Personal adidas ZONE monitors</b></h4>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Key to the process is the student’s possession of their own Zone monitor. Schools can elect to provide each student taking PE remotely with a Zone HRM out of their class inventory or require the student to purchase one on their own through IHT’s online portal - <a href="http://shop.ihtusa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shop.ihtusa.com</a>. The necessary starter elements include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas ZONE for IHT Spirit heart rate monitor;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">personal adidas ZONE for IHT Spirit individual charger;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to the IHT Spirit Zone Heart Rate Software.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Zone, students can select their activity and start and stop workouts through the IHT Spirit Mobile App while retaining all of the functionality the Spirit System provides:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a connection with their class;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emailed heart rate reports immediately following the workout;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ability to make journal entries about the workout.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through easy engagement, students start their exercise with instruction and motivation and end it with a social and emotional query, journaling and progress tracking throughout the year as they develop habits to transform their fitness life.</span>
