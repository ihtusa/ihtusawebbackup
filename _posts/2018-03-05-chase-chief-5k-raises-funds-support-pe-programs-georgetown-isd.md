Kids laced up their running shoes Sunday in Georgetown to “chase the chief” — the Georgetown police chief, that is.

The <a href="https://chasethechief.georgetown.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sixth Annual Chase the Chief 5K and Fun Run</a> took place at East View High School.

The goal of Chase the Chief is to encourage students and their families to lead active, healthy lives. It’s a joint fitness initiative by the Georgetown Police Department, Georgetown Independent School District and the Georgetown Health Foundation.

Other activities include a police department obstacle course and fitness fair.

Proceeds from Chase the Chief help fund grants for GISD physical education programs. Last year, $19,000 was awarded to GISD physical education departments and was used to purchase recreational and sports equipment, outdoor games, a gymnastics course and scooters.
