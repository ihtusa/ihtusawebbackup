After a month of heart-racing (no pun intended) competition by hundreds of schools across the country, the <a href="https://ihtusa.com/adidas-spirit-challenge/" target="_blank">Spirit Challenge powered by adidas</a> has finally come to a close. Over <strong>17,000 students</strong> participated during the 28-day contest and were able to collectively burn over <strong>6.7 MILLION calories</strong> and spend a total of <strong>790 THOUSAND minutes</strong> in target heart rate. Truly incredible results and we couldn't be prouder to inspire and support such a wonderful initiative.

But participating in the Heart Rate Spirit Challenge wasn't the only way to walk away a winner this fall, we also held a Twitter sweepstakes where schools around the country who do not yet have an <a href="https://ihtusa.com/spirit-system/" target="_blank">IHT Spirit System</a> were able to enter a raffle to win a complete system by tweeting and letting us know that they've committed to doing 1 healthy thing this fall. We were overwhelmed with entries and so excited to read everyone's tweets. We're also very excited to publically announce the winners of the 2015 IHT Spirit Challenge powered by adidas! Drumroll please...
