<strong>adidas Set To Unlock The Health Potential in U.S. Schools</strong>
<strong> </strong>
<strong>Global Sports Brand Announces Partnership With Interactive Health Technologies (IHT)</strong><a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/prize-zone.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1910" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/prize-zone-300x150.jpg" alt="prize zone" width="300" height="150" /></a></article><article>LAS VEGAS, January 6, 2015 – adidas has today announced a new partnership set to pave the way for a new age of fitness technology in schools. During a presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the global sports brand revealed collaboration with Interactive Health Technologies (IHT) that aims to empower young people to become self-motivated in managing their own health.Healthy living is a key issue facing children today, and this partnership is set to give kids individualized goals for PE that will help them realize their own potential. adidas is a leading brand in sports innovation and its miCoach training service has helped elite professionals and consumers maximize their potential through technology and expert guidance. This same commitment to unleashing human potential through custom personal guidance will now come to the U.S. school system through the partnership with IHT.

Since starting three years ago, IHT has pioneered a heart rate monitoring system and customized curriculums in middle schools and high schools throughout the U.S. During the 2014 school year, 240,000 children have been connected to the IHT system and they are now on track to have a daily interaction with over one million students a day by 2016.

Jen Ohlson, Co-Founder &amp; President of IHT said: “We are delighted to be partnering with adidas and leveraging the miCoach service on this new venture. When we started on this journey, we knew that there was a lot to be done in order to change the way that health is seen in the United States and beyond. We have already made great strides in developing a system that brings together exercise and academics in a program making a real difference.”

The partnership with adidas will allow IHT to continue to grow and provide innovative health solutions to even more schools throughout the U.S. and beyond. adidas will bring existing expertise in the area of performance and heart rate monitoring, alongside a monthly challenge program including a summer institute for PE teachers that will allow IHT to bring heart rate technology to more students more efficiently than ever before.

Stacey Burr, VP and General Manager – adidas Digital Sports said “We are really excited about the new partnership with IHT. Our miCoach training system is all about unleashing the very best in human potential in a way that is simple and personalized through the use of heart rate.  We found our goals to be aligned with those of IHT and feel that the collaboration represents a fantastic opportunity to help thousands of school children achieve this. By bringing the adidas miCoach system together with IHT, we can help more young people unlock their potential leading to active and healthier lifestyles.”
