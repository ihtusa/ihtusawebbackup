<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Childhood favorite finds new purpose in Spirit Challenge-winning activity</span></i></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By adding a new twist to a backyard game, </span><a href="http://popl.ink/HrGZBz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portland (Mich.) High School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> physical education students push themselves to exercise in a healthy fitness zone by re-connecting them with what many high schoolers consider a childhood past-time: the frisbee.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Portland P.E. teacher Andy Pulling’s </span><a href="https://ihtusa.wishpond.com/lessons-from-a-superstar/entries/170007118"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun Frisbee Fitness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lesson keeps students moving, uses national standards, can be duplicated at any grade level and teaches the importance of teamwork along with fitness. Pulling’s lesson ranked as one of six winning submissions in last fall’s </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/adidas-challenge-winners-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT Spirit Video Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> powered by adidas, and his superstar lesson is the March adidas Lesson for IHT Spirit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s just a kids’ toy at the secondary level,” Pulling said. “But when we teach them how to play ultimate frisbee or do frisbee golf, it’s kind of like their youthful excitement comes back to life.”</span><!--more-->
<h3><b>‘They just eat it up’</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fun Frisbee Fitness lesson works as an introductory lesson in a unit that includes ultimate frisbee and disc golf. The lesson takes the backyard game of “<a href="https://www.kanjam.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kan Jam</a>” – where players simply take turns throwing frisbees at a target, looking to acquire points – and adds an active element to it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a high-energy game the way we have it set up,” Pulling said. “The original game is just a backyard game. It’s pretty laid back. We’ve added some agility to it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling’s original lesson included simply playing the backyard game after going through a dynamic warm-up, though that didn’t last long.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“At first we simply played the original game, and I noticed pretty quickly that, ‘man, there’s no fitness here,’” he recalled. “We added in some rules to adapt it, and that got the kids exhausted in barely two minutes, so we added in some rounds and making them shorter.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The tweaks to the standard game have been embraced by students. Over the course of a 45-minute workout, students go through numerous 30-second </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/fit-life-utilizes-hiit-principles-in-physical-education/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">circuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where they throw the frisbee at a target and run to switch places after each throw. Pulling sees his students hustling, working together as a team and, most importantly, enjoying putting themselves through a workout that improves their cardiovascular fitness.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“They just eat it up and don’t realize how hard they are working,” he said. “As a teacher I push them a little bit harder because I know they’re enjoying this activity. At the end of it, they’re sweating, they’re laughing, they’re enjoying it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling attributes a degree of the unit’s success to the consistency in format students have become accustomed to. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know students learn better when they can predict what’s coming next,” Pulling said. “Having that same structure in your lessons, so if you’re doing a heart rate check at the beginning of the lesson, do it at the beginning every single time.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He introduces the unit by presenting students with a standardized rubric that outlines everything he wants students to learn from the lesson:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manually calculating <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21268470" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">maximum heart rate (MHR)</a> prior to activity</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dynamic warm-up including aspects of the <a href="https://pyfp.org/">Presidential Youth Fitness Program</a> testing</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding of game rules and expectations</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manually calculating heart rate during activity and tracking the fitness zone in which each student is exercising.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a learning routine that we stick to every day,” Pulling said. “Our classes can do this with our eyes closed because it follows our format. We go through our warm-up; we always have an introductory phase where we do the first heart rate check and discuss the knowledge component of what’s going to happen in the lesson and then we just get right into it.”</span>
<h3><b>Focusing on Heart Rate with frisbee fitness</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling began including heart rate in his program several years ago and has increased his focus every year. All of Portland’s ninth graders take a semester of PE every year, and over the course of 18 weeks they become intimately familiar with heart rate, target heart rate zones and how long they need to </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/students-develop-lifetime-skill-exercising-elevated-heart-rate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exercise at an elevated heart rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to maximize the cardiovascular benefits.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do heart rate in a lot of different lessons, so when we get to this unit, they know how to do that and where they should be,” he said. “The talking points in the rubrics have all been refined so they are a little bit more simple, the kids can see it and understand it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Students haven’t been the only learners in the process. By shifting the focus of each class, Pulling found a better way to motivate students to maximize their effort. When tasked with achieving an individualized goal as opposed to the score of a game, <a href="https://ihtusa.com/motivating-heart-rate-monitors-p-e-students-effort/">students work harder</a>.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now the motivation is really the self-motivation, the self-drive of ‘can I challenge myself to get into my healthy fitness zone?” he said. “And, ‘what can I do to keep it there?’ That’s how I get my students to understand. You change the approach from who’s winning to ‘what am I doing to be healthy?’ They really learn to own their health and physical fitness.” </span>
<h3><b>Teaching the value of an active lifestyle</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling’s known he wanted to teach since he was an eighth-grader listening to a college professor deliver a career-day presentation. Once he identified teaching as a passion, he’s tried to use his platform in physical education to help students learn to enjoy being active.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“P.E. teachers, I think, are pretty inventive,” he said. “We do a pretty good job of getting kids moving.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling tries to use that inventiveness to connect with students who have yet to find their passion for physical activity, students who may be struggling in a classroom environment. In many cases, he said, the students respond to the change of educational scenery the gymnasium offers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can take them into the gym and get to know who they are and figure out what types of activity they enjoy and have them doing it,” he said. “Then you start to see them start to value activity and then that light bulb goes on and they realize that they do feel better or they do eat better or sleep better now that they are doing these active things during the day.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m no miracle worker,” Pulling concluded. “But every once in a while, you get these kids that are really struggling with events and school and we have this little magic wildcard that they haven’t been introduced to properly. When they are, they value it.”</span>
