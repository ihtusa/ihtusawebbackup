<span style="font-weight: 400;">During our </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/advisory-summit-brings-pe-leaders-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advisory and Innovation Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some of the country’s top physical education experts discussed the wearable technology transformation and the concerns of protecting their investments in new technology. The experts agree that a self-funded insurance model provides schools the biggest benefit. </span>

Principal Ryan Welnetz[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Focused primarily on our new </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adidas Zone for IHT Spirit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> monitor, teachers and administrators wanted to know how they could increase loss prevention and protect themselves from extra costs by damage or loss. Ryan Welnetz, principal at </span><a href="http://suamicohssd.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suamico Elementary School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the </span><a href="http://www.hssd.k12.wi.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howard-Suamico (Wisc.) School District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, detailed how his district charges a supplemental fee for students to use iPads and laptops throughout the school year, how the self-insurance program protects both school and individual from damage and how a similar plan might work for new devices that students share across multiple class periods. This information is helpful in supporting schools using the Zone and </span><a href="https://ihtusa.com/spirit-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT Spirit System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">School-issued devices becoming the norm</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to reports published a year apart by </span><a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2013-03-01-4-5-million-and-counting-ipads-in-u-s-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EdSurge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2014/04/08/a-third-of-secondary-students-use-school-issued-mobile-devices.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one in three U.S. students use school-issued technology. In England, the </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/education-30216408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BBC </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports that schools provide tablet computers to 7 of 10 students. Apple and Google rank among the most popular school-provided devices. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple had sold more than 4.5 million iPads to schools by 2013</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google had partnered with more than 2,000 schools by 2013 </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Howard-Suamico School District (HSSD) provides students with either </span><a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPad Air</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tablets or </span><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MacBook Air</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> computers. The devices represent a major investment for students: 64 GB iPad models retail for $499 and 11-inch MacBook Air laptops start at $899. Google’s </span><a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chromebooks </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">start as low as $180, which includes a management fee. While schools don’t pay retail prices, the cost to provide devices to students remains significant.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Allowing students access to modern technology is great, but in the hands of K-12 students, how can we protect our investment into education? Two resolutions becoming more prevalent are technology fees and the accompanying guidelines.</span>
<h2>Devices come with technology fee</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">HSSD provides devices for students once they reach the third grade: iPads for younger students and MacBook Air laptops for high schoolers. The district charges a technology insurance fee on each device, both non-refundable after 15 days. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPad - issued to students in grades 3-8: $35 annual fee</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students keep devices during the school year only</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MacBook Air - issued to students in grades 9-12: $99 annual fee</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students maintain possession of device through 12th grade</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/c74584_8b4e87c1413c41da9b9ac716393c9752.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fee </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">covers families for two instances of accidental damage. Other guidelines include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two repairs, subsequent repair costs are shared evenly between HSSD and family</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damage reports must be filed with the HSSD Media Center within 48 hours</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stolen devices must include a police report</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other school systems charge different fees dependent on the device and the demographics, and most provide waivers for families in free or reduced-cost lunch programs. </span>

</ul>
<h2>Self-insurance policy guidelines</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">While HSSD purchases or leases its devices from </span><a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the district does not purchase Apple’s support option, </span><a href="http://www.apple.com/support/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AppleCare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That choice results in significant savings for HSSD. Though school districts often get price breaks based on large-volume orders, support remains </span><a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/applecare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">costly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iPad AppleCare support: $99</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MacBook Air AppleCare support: $249 </span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">By declining AppleCare, HSSD needed to come up with its own policy. The HSSD self-insurance plan covers all damage short of the obviously intentional and loss.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unless it’s blatant…the kid picks it up and throws it against the wall or stomps on it with his foot, it’s covered in full,” Welnetz said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In those cases: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HSSD invoices family full replacement cost of damaged device</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full replacement cost determined by current market value</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Districts must develop collections policy</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The repair process strives to keep devices in students’ hands. To accomplish that, HSSD purchases extra devices as part of its initial order. Having a surplus of devices comes at an extra upfront cost to the district, but Welnetz said it’s part of the cost of providing students with devices, making sure they don’t lose access to information or assignment during the repair.</span>
<h2>Insurance on shared devices</h2>
[caption id="attachment_2429" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tapin.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2429" src="https://ihtusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tapin-230x300.jpg" alt="insurance" width="230" height="300" /></a> Michael Posey, an administrator with DC Public Schools, demonstrates the pick-up method utilized by the IHT Spirit System[/caption]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">How schools ensure devices shared by multiple classes or students is a largely undeveloped space. </span><a href="http://bayviewhssd.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay View Middle School</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also in the HSSD, utilizes IHT Spirit System chest strap heart rate monitors at present but will be adding Zone monitors this fall.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you share from class to class, it gets a little tougher,” Welnetz said of the logistics around distributing and collecting monitors for each class.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Spirit System’s design, theft or loss becomes less of an issue. The pick-up and return method takes shared device insurance into account. Each monitor is assigned to a specific student, which allows teachers to identify which students haven’t checked devices back in at the close of class. With this strategy, schools know who to contact if devices go missing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We see the benefit of a self-insurance plan for schools using these shared devices. Schools can charge a small fee -- a percentage of the device’s retail price -- and create a pool by which they can purchase replacements when necessary. A benefit: if the fund has money left at the end of the school year, that money could be used to fund the next round of Zone purchases.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">IHT developed the Zone as a tool to improve physical education, helping students see their exertion level and understand how that impacts their health and well-being. We appreciate that schools dedicate precious financial resources to purchasing this type of technology and we want to help protect that investment.</span>
